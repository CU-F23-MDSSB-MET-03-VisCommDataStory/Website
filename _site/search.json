You will write the report such that a non Data Scientist can enjoy reading it and gain some insights about the datastory you tell."

However, I will not count words and I will not assess based on fulfilling the word count. Anyway, essential parts the submissions will be visual.\nDetails about the project report: The project report is a website which tells a data story which is rendered with quarto.\nIt includes\n\na slide deck used to tell the story in a presentation,\na written report tells the story for readers and gives more details and more visuals, e.g. in Appendices.\n\nOptional the submission can also include a dashboard with interactive graphs which enables individual exploration by the reader.\nThe report must be reproducible. That means the source code must be provided.\nHowever, the report must be readable without reading code. The target audience is not a programmer and they should not see code while reading. Technical parts should be in the appendix.\nA template repo will be provided later.\n\nDelivery via GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can make your data story into a nice thing to show your competence to the outside world. It is not too difficult to publish the report as a website from your final repository. Make your report such that it is worth to publish and show it!"

However, there may be activities where this does not work.\nSome expected contribution will appear here more specific later."

    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nYou are encouraged to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be very helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learing time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot (free to use for students and teachers in VSCode) are heavily used and currently revolutionize code writting a bit. They can speed up writung your code. However, they do not deliver always correct solutions. There is no way around understanding yourself what a code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code, expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Data science is also about formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results. This is all verbal text and chatbots are good in writing text which often appears as well readable. You can use this inspire you and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! Text generated purely by chatbots, it often becomes evident that you do not. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible text. Also text written by chatbots is often very generic and less specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Large parts of very generic text is considered worse than a shorter more specific text. In extreme case, we may a long very generic text will be considered worse than no text at all\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\n\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work."
